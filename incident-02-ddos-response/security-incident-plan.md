DDoS Security Incident Response Plan Using NIST CSF

This document outlines a plan to improve the multimedia companyâ€™s network security following a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The plan addresses the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions to mitigate risks and enhance resilience.
Incident Background
The company, providing web design, graphic design, and social media marketing, suffered a DDoS attack that flooded the internal network with ICMP packets, disrupting services for two hours. The attack exploited an unconfigured firewall, allowing a malicious actor to overwhelm the network. The incident management team blocked ICMP packets, stopped non-critical services, and restored critical operations. The cybersecurity team implemented firewall rules to limit ICMP packet rates, IP address verification, network monitoring software, and an IDS/IPS system.

NIST CSF-Based Security Plan
1. Identify
Objective: Identify security risks through audits of networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to find potential gaps.

Actions Taken:
Conducted a post-incident audit, identifying the unconfigured firewall as the primary vulnerability.
Reviewed network assets (e.g., servers, workstations, firewalls) to map critical systems.


Recommendations:
Perform regular network audits to identify misconfigurations and outdated systems.
Create an asset inventory to classify critical network resources (e.g., web servers, client databases).
Assess access privileges to ensure only authorized personnel manage network configurations.



2. Protect
Objective: Implement policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats.

Actions Taken:
Added a firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
Enabled source IP address verification to block spoofed ICMP packets.


Recommendations:
Develop a network security policy mandating regular firewall configuration reviews.
Train IT staff on secure firewall management and DDoS mitigation strategies.
Deploy additional protective tools, such as web application firewalls (WAFs), to safeguard client-facing services.



3. Detect
Objective: Improve monitoring capabilities to detect potential security incidents quickly and efficiently.

Actions Taken:
Installed network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
Deployed an IDS/IPS system to filter suspicious ICMP traffic.


Recommendations:
Configure real-time alerts for traffic spikes exceeding normal thresholds (e.g., 10x baseline ICMP traffic).
Integrate security information and event management (SIEM) tools to correlate logs and detect anomalies.
Conduct regular penetration testing to identify undetected vulnerabilities.



4. Respond
Objective: Contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process.

Actions Taken:
Blocked incoming ICMP packets to stop the attack.
Halted non-critical services to prioritize critical network operations.
Analyzed logs to confirm the attack vector (unconfigured firewall).


Recommendations:
Develop a formal incident response plan with clear roles (e.g., incident commander, network analyst).
Create playbooks for DDoS scenarios, outlining steps like traffic filtering and service prioritization.
Conduct post-incident reviews to document lessons learned and update response procedures.



5. Recover
Objective: Restore affected systems to normal operation and recover data or assets impacted by the incident.

Actions Taken:
Restored critical network services after blocking ICMP packets.
Verified system integrity post-attack to ensure no additional compromises.


Recommendations:
Implement regular backups of critical systems (e.g., web servers, client data) to enable rapid recovery.
Test disaster recovery plans to ensure minimal downtime in future incidents.
Communicate with affected clients about the incident and resolution to maintain trust.



Summary of Recommendations
To prevent future DDoS attacks and strengthen network security:

Conduct quarterly network audits and maintain french an asset inventory.
Enforce a network security policy and train staff on DDoS mitigation.
Enhance monitoring with SIEM tools and real-time alerts.
Formalize an incident response plan with DDoS-specific playbooks.
Implement and test backups and disaster recovery plans.

These measures align with NIST CSF, reducing risks and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
