Incident 02: DDoS Response Using NIST CSF

Overview
This project documents my response as a cybersecurity analyst to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a multimedia company’s internal network. The attack, caused by a flood of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall, disrupted network services for two hours. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I developed a plan to improve network security, addressing the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions to mitigate risks and prevent future incidents.

Security Incident Response Plan: Detailed plan using NIST CSF to enhance network security post-DDoS attack.
[Future Work]: May include scripts for monitoring or additional incident analysis.

Incident Summary
The multimedia company, offering web design, graphic design, and social media marketing, experienced a DDoS attack that overwhelmed its network with ICMP packets, blocking access to resources. The incident management team blocked ICMP packets, stopped non-critical services, and restored critical operations. The cybersecurity team identified a misconfigured firewall as the vulnerability and implemented firewall rules, IP verification, network monitoring, and an IDS/IPS system.
