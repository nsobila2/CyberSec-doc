This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Uptown Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Uptown Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

The task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

Recommendations
To address the high risk score (8/10) and improve Uptown Toys’ security posture, the IT manager should prioritize the following:

Implement Least Privilege and Separation of Duties: Restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., cardholder data, PII/SPII) to authorized personnel only to reduce insider threats.
Deploy Encryption: Encrypt credit card data during storage, processing, and transmission to comply with PCI DSS and protect customer data.
Establish Disaster Recovery and Backups: Create disaster recovery plans and implement regular backups to ensure business continuity.
Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Enhance network monitoring to detect and respond to potential threats.
Upgrade Password Policies and Management: Enforce complex passwords (e.g., 8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters) and implement a centralized password management system to improve security and productivity.
Schedule Legacy System Maintenance: Define regular monitoring and intervention schedules for legacy systems to reduce vulnerabilities.
Conduct Asset Inventory: Classify and conduct an inventory of assets to support GDPR compliance and improve risk management.
Perform Regular Audits: Conduct periodic internal audits to maintain compliance and address evolving threats.

These actions will mitigate critical risks, ensure compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC, and strengthen Botium Toys’ cybersecurity.
